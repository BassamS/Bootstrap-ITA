# Bootstrap project

## Description:

This project is part of a series of exercises I did in a Frontend Web Development Bootcamp with Barcelona Activaâ€™s It Academy. 
The project is thought as a storytelling blog or website, but it could be adapted for individual or professional and commercial use. The design is adaptive and responsive. 

## Technologies used:

### HTML5
### CSS3 
### Bootstrap
